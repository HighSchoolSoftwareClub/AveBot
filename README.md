# AveBot

Will extend later. 

FAQ:
- Uses python3
- `pip install -U discord.py`
- is not public
- `echo -n "bot's token" > bottoken`
- wondering what a token is? [go here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), authenticate, create a new app, create a bot, click on `click to reveal` under username. Enjoy.
